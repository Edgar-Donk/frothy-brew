Colour Picker
=============

While there are a load of rgbahsv colour pickers out there it is still  
useful to make one.

Let's use the colour picker in paint.net as an example, and keep it simple
at the start, use the canvas to display our gradient, then use a scale 
underneath the canvas and a spinbox to show the value of the scale. If both 
the scale and its associated spinbox point to the same tk variable they 
should affect each other. At the same time the gradient should change with the 
value on with each colour component.
