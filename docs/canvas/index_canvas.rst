tkinter Canvas
==============

Canvas is the graphical workhorse for tkinter. One can run scripts to make
drawings, import pictures and widgets, sketch in real time and run 
animations. If you have not used it maybe now is a good time to try.

One shortcoming is its method of saving as postscript or a ps file. These 
formats are vector graphic images and are no longer in vogue - svg is the
network standard for vector graphics.
