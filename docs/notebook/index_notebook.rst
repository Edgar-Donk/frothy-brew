The appearance of this widget is similar to simple internet sites, with 
the active window showing and the hidden windows being accesible by clicking
on tabs. In many applications we need to perform actions in strict sequence 
so not all tabs are necessarily accessible until some requirements have been 
fulfilled - in these cases disabling/enabling is used.
